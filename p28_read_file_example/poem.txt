You should be able to build a wasm app that uses ethers-rs (see the example for reference). 
If ethers fails to compile in WASM, please open an issue. There is currently no plan to provide an official JS/TS-accessible library interface. 
we believe ethers.js serves that need very well.

Similarly, you should be able to build FFI bindings to ethers-rs. 
If ethers fails to compile in c lib formats, please open an issue. 
There is currently no plan to provide official FFI bindings, and as ethers-rs is not yet stable 1.0.0, its interface may change significantly between versions.
